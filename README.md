TASK : 4.DIGITAL FILTER DESIGN
This project focuses on the design and simulation of a Digital Finite Impulse Response (FIR) Filter using Verilog. FIR filters are widely used in digital signal processing applications due to their inherent stability and linear phase characteristics. The Verilog implementation allows the filter to process discrete input signals and produce filtered output based on predefined coefficients. The design supports configurable filter order and coefficients, making it flexible for various use cases. A testbench is included to simulate the filter's behavior with sample inputs and verify the correctness of the output. Simulation results demonstrate how the filter attenuates or passes certain frequency components. This project serves as a hands-on introduction to digital filter design and highlights the practical application of signal processing techniques in hardware.
